These materials are designed to be covered in the following order

1. MATLAB basics
2. Symbolic mathematics
3. Arrays
4. If statements
5. Loops
6. Functions
7. Plotting

## MATLAB Live Scripts
The materials which will help you to learn how to program in MATLAB use MATLAB Live Scripts which allow you to type in commands and see the results within the same live document. MATLAB live scripts have the file extension .mlx and can be opened either by double clicking on the file in a file manager or opened within MATLAB.

## Installing MATLAB on your own machine
